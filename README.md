# OBS Countdown Timer

The countdown scripts I could find for OBS didn't work exactly how I wanted, so I wrote these simple shell scripts to do it.

To use the timer, setup a text item in OBS, set to read from a file, and point it at the `countdown.txt` file generated by these scripts.

## BitBar Integration

The `OBS-Countdown.sh` is a script that's intended for integration with [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#get-started). To use it, crease a Symlink to the BitBar plugins folder:

```
ln -s ~/obs/countdown/OBS-Countdown.sh ~/bitbar/OBS-Countdown.sh

```

This will give a ‚è∞ icon in the menu bar, with Reset and Start commands.

## Utility

By default, Teams won't recognize the OBS virtual camera. To fix it, run the `fixteams.sh`. This will need to be done each time teams is updated.
